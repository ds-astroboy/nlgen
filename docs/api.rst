Due to the heavy flux of the apis, there is currently no explicit documentation.

However, there is a fairly extensive unit testing suite. It's recommended to look at those for now:

- CFG example: https://github.com/toumorokoshi/nlgen/blob/master/nlgen/tests/cfg/test_full.py
- Using the text representation of a CFG: https://github.com/toumorokoshi/nlgen/blob/master/nlgen/tests/cfg/test_markup_parser.py
